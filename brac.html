            <p>Progoti loans are provided to both male and female entrepreneurs to invest in existing small enterprises, which are too small to qualify for credit from mainstream banks. The loans provide flexibility for entrepreneurs seeking to expand their businesses. This supports employment generation and helps drive local economies and inclusive growth.
